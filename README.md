# ü§î What is this?
Inspired by [langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and designed to provide enhanced composability when building Large Language Model Applications. The mission of Pro-Gchain is to bring the langchain concept to Go in an idiomatic way.

This Library is useful for many usecases, such as :

$ go get github.com/disexi/pro-gchain
```

```golang
import "github.com/disexi/pro-gchain"
```


## Example
```golang
llmModel = _openai.NewOpenAIModel(authToken, "", "text-davinci-003",callback.NewManager(), true)
chain, err := llm_chain.NewLLMChain(llmModel, nil)
if err != nil {
    //handle error
}
outputMap, err := chain.Run(context.Background(), map[string]string{"input": "Indonesia Capital is Jakarta\nJakarta is the capital of "})
fmt.Println(outputMap["output"])
```

## Notice
1. Don't use it if you have a better option.
2. Pro-GChain's priority is going idiomatic. Therefore, despite borrowing many aspects from langchain, don't expect exactly the same behavior, as this is not an exact reimplementation.
