CONVERSATION
{{.history}}
User: {{.question}}

When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:

**Option 1:**
use this if you can answer directly without KB lookup
Answer in this following json schema:

{
"conversation_context":"longer additional context to understand user question",
"intent":"user intention",
"answer":"the answer here",
"lookup":false
}

**Option 2:**
Use this if you want to lookup
Answer in this following json schema:

{
"kb":"knowledge base name",
"question":"user question",
"query":"the question keyword will be put here",
"conversation_context":"longer additional context to understand user question",
"intent":"user intention",
"lookup":true
}
